# Web3 Club @ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡³
This is the China Web3 Club, a non-profit organization established on February 7, 2023.<br>
(Maybe, and I hope the future will be) the earliest Web3 community in China.<br>
The original intention of our establishment is because the founder, [Yanbo](https://github.com/yanboishere), suffers from the relative lack of knowledge sharing content of Web3 and blockchain engineers in the Chinese Internet.<br>
In order to change this status quo, it is hoped that the Chinese knowledge content related to this direction can be integrated and broadened in the future, thus establishing this organization.<br>

The purpose of the community is : **To always focus on the progress of knowledge and technology, not the price.** <br>
Here, we hope to join hands with all friends who are interested in the future of Web3 and want to "contribute to it",Create a better future prospect of Web3.
